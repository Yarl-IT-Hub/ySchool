Hibenate Pojo Generation with HibernatePojoGenerator [1]

Steps:
1.The project is cloned from github [2]

2. Edited the pom.vm inside hbnpojogen / hbnpojogen-core / src / main / resources / templates
   Removed $dependencies as it enforces at least one via <! [CDATA]> in yschoolHib.xml
   Changed versions for apache felees (hard-coded 1.4.32 or can go with 1.4.4) and net.sf.ehcache (from 1.6.1 to 2.6.6 because the older version wasn't available in repositories)


3. set the yschool_hib.xml which inside pojoGeneration directory

4. generated Pojo classes, DAO, tests etc via terminal, command "java -jar hbnpojogen-core-1.4.32-jar-with-dependencies.jar yschool_hib.xml"


Issues

1.  <dependency>
    	<groupId>com.felees</groupId>
   		<artifactId>hbnpojogen-persistence</artifactId>
   		<!-- <version>1.4.32</version> --> <version> 1.4.32</version>
    </dependency>

  The artifact is missing in maven repositories thus maven could n't resolve it.

   As a temporary solution the jar is downloaded (or built from the cloned project) and manually added to the local repository, .m2

          Resources: 1.4.4 can be downloaded from here [3]

                       both 1.4.4 and 1.4.3 are in this directory


          Manual addition: It can be done via the following command or the manual pasting inside $HOME Dirctory-> /.m2/repository/com/felees/hbnpojogen-persistence
                             mvn install:install-file -Dfile=modules\lite_repo\hbnPojoGenResource\hbnpojogen-persistence-1.4.4.jar -DgroupId=com.felees -DartifactId=hbnpojogen-persistence -Dversion=1.4.4 -Dpackaging=jar
